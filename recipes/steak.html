  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This steak marinade is a family recipe that has been developed only over the last 5 years. In this short time, it's made me famous in our close circle, but until now I've never shared it with anyone.</p> 
  <h2>Steak Marinade Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Oil</strong>: This top-rated steak marinade recipe starts with olive oil, which keeps the meat nice and moist.</li>
    <li><strong>Sauces</strong>: You'll need Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. Hot sauce is optional, but it's a great addition for people who appreciate a little heat.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Lemon juice</strong>: The acidity from the lemon juice cuts through the other flavors, adding welcome brightness. The acid also helps tenderize the meat even further.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: This flavorful marinade is seasoned with dried basil, garlic powder, dried parsley flakes, white pepper, and minced garlic.
