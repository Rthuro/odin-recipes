  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>These jalapeño poppers are creamy in the middle with crispy bacon on the outside. They're easy to make and taste so much better than traditional poppers.  </p>
  <h2>Jalapeño Popper Ingredients
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cream cheese</strong> and <strong>cheese</strong>: The rich jalapeño popper filling is a blend of equal parts cream cheese and shredded Cheddar cheese.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Jalapeños</strong>: We recommend wearing food-grade gloves while you remove the seeds and membranes to prevent burning your skin.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Bacon</strong>: Of course, you'll need bacon to wrap up your cream cheese-stuffed jalapeños!  </li>
  </ul>
